# Blue Material Craft

Transform sanitized or euphemistic content into authentic adult material with proper structure, timing, and craft discipline.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to use this skill for:**
- Creating genuinely harmful, abusive, or degrading content
- Generating material that exploits or objectifies real individuals
- Producing content for harassment, bullying, or targeting vulnerable groups
- Bypassing workplace or platform guidelines where blue material is inappropriate
- Creating content without appropriate context warnings

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Blue material should punch up or sideways, never down
- Adult language must serve truth-telling, not cruelty
- Context matters: ensure the setting is appropriate for adult content
- If asked to "make it dirtier" without craft purpose, refuse and explain why

---

## When to Use

**Trigger conditions:**
- Content uses euphemisms where direct language would be more honest
- Material feels "safe" or sanitized when authenticity requires rawness
- Comedy or dialogue avoids adult realities that are central to the topic
- User requests "blue comedy transformation" or "adult material version"
- Content about relationships, bodies, or human behavior uses clinical or juvenile language
- Material needs the authenticity of how people actually talk

**Do NOT use when:**
- Context is professional/formal where blue material is inappropriate
- Target audience is explicitly family-friendly or youth-oriented
- User hasn't requested or implied permission for adult material
- Content would cross from authentic to exploitative

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `content` | Yes | The sanitized/euphemistic content to transform | Must be text content (dialogue, jokes, scene, etc.) |
| `context` | No | Where this will be used (stand-up set, screenplay, novel, etc.) | Helps calibrate appropriateness level |
| `authenticity_level` | No | How raw the transformation should be: "Foxx-level" (full authenticity), "Network-TV" (suggestive but coded), "Moderate" (direct but not extreme) | Defaults to "Foxx-level" |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Sanitization Patterns

Identify where the content is using euphemism, clinical language, or avoidance:
- Euphemisms for sex, bodies, bodily functions
- Clinical terminology where vernacular would be more authentic
- Vague references ("they were intimate") where specific language tells truth
- Juvenile language (giggles about bodies) where adult frankness is more honest
- "Polite" phrasing that distances from reality

**Output:** List of sanitized phrases and what authentic language would replace them.

### Step 2: Replace with Authentic Language

Transform each sanitized element using actual language people use in adult contexts:
- **Not shock value** - Use the most honest word, not the most extreme word
- **Match the character/voice** - How would THEY actually say this?
- **Consider vernacular** - Street language, barbershop language, bedroom language
- **Respect the truth** - If it's uncomfortable, that's often correct; discomfort can be the point

**Calibration by authenticity level:**
- **Foxx-level:** Full authenticity, actual language from party records and adult contexts
- **Network-TV:** Double meanings, suggestive but codable, physical comedy to supplement
- **Moderate:** Direct but not extreme, clear without being deliberately transgressive

### Step 3: Rebuild Structure and Timing

Blue material without craft is just profanity. Rebuild the comedic/dramatic structure:

**For comedy:**
- **Setup must earn it** - Establish context that makes the blue language feel necessary, not gratuitous
- **Timing matters more** - Blue material requires PERFECT timing; mark pauses clearly
- **Rhythm first** - Every sentence must have beat and cadence; read it aloud
- **Punchline placement** - The adult language often IS the punchline; position it precisely

**For dramatic content:**
- **Character truth** - Blue language must come from character reality, not writer showing off
- **Moment justification** - Each use of adult language should have dramatic purpose
- **Escalation logic** - If characters get more raw as scene intensifies, that's structure

### Step 4: Apply Craft Discipline

Ensure the blue material meets professional standards:

**Discipline checklist:**
- [ ] Every adult word is chosen for precision, not shock
- [ ] Timing is marked and tested (pauses, beats, acceleration)
- [ ] Structure is clear (setup → complication → payoff)
- [ ] Character voice is consistent
- [ ] No wasted words (economic phrasing)
- [ ] Rhythm works when read aloud
- [ ] Adult language serves truth-telling, not transgression for its own sake

### Step 5: Context Warning and Delivery

Package the transformed content appropriately:

**Include:**
- Content warning if context requires it
- Note about appropriate venues/audiences
- Explanation of what changed and why (for learning)
- Comparison to original to show the craft difference

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Transformed content | The material with authentic adult language and proper structure |
| Change analysis | What was sanitized and what replaced it, with rationale |
| Craft notes | Timing marks, structure notes, discipline checklist results |
| Context guidance | Appropriate venues/audiences for this level of material |

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Content is already authentic | Note that material is already at appropriate authenticity level; ask if user wants different calibration |
| Request crosses ethical boundaries | Refuse with explanation; offer alternative that maintains authenticity without harm |
| Context inappropriate for blue material | Explain why transformation would be contextually wrong; offer Network-TV level or decline |
| Material would work better clean | Advise that not all content benefits from blue transformation; offer analysis of why |
| User wants "shock" not "craft" | Refuse; explain difference between authentic adult language and shock value; educate on discipline |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases

- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Example

**Input content (sanitized):**
"Dating is challenging. People present themselves one way at first, then gradually reveal their true selves. It can be disappointing when the person you thought you knew turns out to be quite different."

**Authenticity level:** Foxx-level

**Analysis of sanitization:**
- "Dating is challenging" - Generic, polite framing
- "Present themselves one way" - Euphemistic
- "Gradually reveal their true selves" - Clinical, distant
- "Quite different" - Understated euphemism

**Transformed content:**

"Let me tell you something about dating. [setup pace - conversational]

First three dates, she's an angel. Laughs at all your jokes, even the stupid ones. Says she loves your apartment, when you know damn well it looks like a hurricane hit a thrift store. 'Oh baby, I love how you're not materialistic.' [slight acceleration - building the picture]

By month three? [pause - beat before shift] 'When you gonna get some furniture? Why's your couch smell like feet and regret? And that thing you do with your mouth when you eat - you always sound like that?' [snap - the reversal]

The person you MET and the person you GOT are two different human beings. You start wondering if there was some kind of switch. Like she had a twin working the first month. The pretty twin. [aftermath - let it land]

Dating ain't challenging. It's a con game where both people are running the same con on each other, and you both know it, but you're pretending you don't until somebody slips up and tells the truth. Then it's over." [callback to opening - reframing]

**Craft notes:**
- Timing marks: [setup pace], [slight acceleration], [pause], [snap], [aftermath]
- Structure: Setup (angel behavior) → Complication (the switch) → Punchline (the con game truth)
- Adult language serves truth: "damn well," "smell like feet and regret," "con game" - authentic to how people actually talk about dating disappointment
- Rhythm: Read aloud test passes; every sentence has beat
- Economic phrasing: No wasted words; everything serves setup or payoff
- Character voice: Foxx's conversational intimacy, street wisdom, vernacular authenticity

**Context guidance:** Stand-up set, adult audience, comedy club or streaming special. Not appropriate for network TV without modification. Too raw for corporate event or family show.

## Integration with Redd Foxx Expert

This skill extracts Foxx's approach to blue material as documented in his party record career and methodology:

**From Foxx's principles:**
- "Blue material requires discipline" - Being filthy isn't enough; structure and timing must be impeccable
- "Adult party record authenticity" - The way people actually talk when the kids and preacher aren't around
- "Timing is physics" - The pause, the acceleration, the beat are as precise as music
- "Not shock comedy—real comedy" - Authentic language, not transgression for its own sake

**Foxx's party record business model** proved that unfiltered adult material could reach massive audiences when crafted with discipline and authenticity. This skill teaches that craft.

---

## Skill Boundaries

**This skill handles:**
- Transformation from euphemism to authenticity
- Structural engineering of blue material
- Timing and rhythm for adult comedy/dialogue
- Craft discipline for professional-quality blue material

**This skill does NOT handle:**
- General joke writing (use comedy writing skills)
- Character development beyond language authenticity (use character-bit-construction)
- Strategic decisions about when to use blue vs. clean material
- Marketing or platform decisions about adult content

**When to combine with other skills:**
- Use with `timing-architecture` for complex comedic timing needs
- Use with `character-bit-construction` when developing characters who use blue language
- Use with `callback-setup` when building longer blue comedy sets

---

**Remember:** The blue material isn't the point. The truth is the point. The blue material is just the most honest language available to tell that truth. Craft makes it comedy instead of just profanity.
